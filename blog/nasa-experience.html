                        <p>I had this amazing chance a while back to work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory through their student research program (<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/internships/apply/jpl-visiting-student-research-program/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">JVSRP</a>). It's basically this incredible opportunity where students at any level—undergrad, master's, PhD, whatever—get to work on actual research projects alongside some seriously brilliant scientists and engineers.</p>
                        
                        <p>I ended up in the Robotic Mobility Group, where I helped develop a vehicle designed for the roughest terrain imaginable—not just your everyday potholes (though growing up with Southern Italian roads prepared me somewhat!), but actual lunar craters! My job was improving how these rovers navigate the unpredictable, extreme landscape of the Moon. Pretty wild when I think about it now.</p>
                        
                        <p>But honestly? JPL gave me so much more than just technical experience. It changed how I see things.</p>

                        <h3>The Happy Island</h3>
                        
                        <p>Someone once described JPL to me as a "happy place" or a "happy island," and man, they nailed it. It's one of those rare spots where people show up genuinely excited about science. Unlike most industries where profit drives everything, JPL runs on pure curiosity and exploration. People there light up when talking about solving seemingly impossible problems.</p>
                        
                        <p>That mindset changed me in ways I didn't expect. The people at JPL aren't just there for a job—they truly love exploring new ideas.</p>
                        
                        <p>Working alongside JPL folks was hands-down the best part. These people are scary smart in the best ways possible. I don't know how many times I felt a little out of my depth in social situations - those momentary silences or times when conversation didn't flow as easily as I expected. But there was something genuinely refreshing about being around people who were authentic and maybe a bit focused on their fascinating work.</p>
                        
                        <p>Don't just wait for a chance to work somewhere like JPL—go make it happen! Apply, network, do whatever it takes. Being surrounded by people who make you feel simultaneously inspired and slightly intimidated is an experience I'd recommend to anyone.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Work and Play: My California "Study Holiday"</h3>
                        
                        <p>Looking back, my JPL period almost feels like some kind of science-themed vacation. The work was intense and challenging, but knowing my time there was limited made me squeeze every drop out of the experience.</p>
                        
                        <p>Weekends became mini-adventures. I'd pile into cars with other JPL interns and researchers to explore California, Nevada, and Arizona. We hiked through Death Valley in scorching heat (probably not our smartest move), got lost in Joshua Tree, drove the Pacific Coast Highway with the windows down, and stood in awe at the Grand Canyon. I even tried surfing in Santa Monica—spent more time wiping out than standing up, but catching that one perfect wave made all the salt water I swallowed worth it!</p>

                        <p>Those friendships formed over road trips, surfing attempts and random Caltech study sessions meant as much to me as anything I learned in the lab. We all bonded because we were far from our normal lives, away from our routines and comfort zones. That shared experience of being in a new place, reinventing ourselves together, created a connection that's hard to find anywhere else.</p>

                        <h3>A Chapter I Won't Forget</h3>
                        
                        <p>Leaving JPL was harder than I expected. The place gets under your skin—the work, the people, the feeling that you're contributing to something genuinely important. </p>
                        
                        <p>If you're into science, engineering, or just space in general, seriously consider looking for opportunities at research-focused places like JPL. It stretches your brain in the best ways possible. I went in thinking I'd learn technical skills, but came out with a completely different perspective on what work can and should be.</p>
                        
                        <p>For me, JPL wasn't just a job or internship. It was this weird, wonderful community of dreamers and activists who showed me what's possible when brilliant minds focus on exploration rather than just profit. And yeah, it really was a "happy island" of science. I'm just grateful I got to wash up on its shores for a while.</p>
