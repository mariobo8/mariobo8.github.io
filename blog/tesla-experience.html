                <div class="blog-article__content">
                    <div class="blog-article__container bd-grid">                        
                        <p>When people talk about engineering jobs, they often focus on the technical challenges. But after my time at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory, I realized something important: what really changes from company to company isn't just the engineering itself—it's the impact your work has.</p>
                        
                        <p>The biggest eye-opener working at Tesla was seeing how even the smallest design improvement could create massive ripple effects. A tiny cost reduction or efficiency gain that might seem insignificant in isolation suddenly becomes revolutionary when multiplied across hundreds of thousands of vehicles. That's the reality of high-scale manufacturing that textbooks can't quite convey.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Powertrain and Responsibility</h3>
                        
                        <p>I joined the powertrain development team, where my main responsibility was validating design changes to the drive units. This meant ensuring every modification we proposed was both safe and functional before implementation. It wasn't just theoretical work—decisions I helped make would eventually affect vehicles on roads around the world.</p>
                        
                        <p>What surprised me most was the level of ownership Tesla expected, even from interns. I certainly didn't walk in expecting to shoulder so much responsibility from day one, but they essentially threw me into the deep end—and I loved it. There's something incredibly empowering about people trusting your judgment on consequential projects. As we say in Italian, it's like having "vento in poppa" (wind in your sails) when colleagues believe in your capabilities.</p>
                        
                        <div class="blog-article__image-container">
                            <div class="blog-article__featured-img">
                                <img src="../assets/img/blog/tesla-experience/tesla_kit.png" alt="starter kit, Tesla">
                            </div>
                        </div> 

                        <h3>Factory Floor Immediacy</h3>
                        
                        <p>One of the perfect aspects of working at the Berlin Gigafactory was how the office essentially attached to the production line. Whenever we needed to check something, we'd simply put on safety boots, walk a few steps, and be right in the middle of everything. Being able to instantly touch components you helped design, witness the manufacturing process firsthand, and see the impressive automation in action created an immediate feedback loop that's rare in engineering environments.</p>
                        
                        <p>This proximity to production gave our work a tangible quality. Ideas weren't just concepts on a screen—they were physical objects taking shape right beside us. The line between design and implementation blurred in the most satisfying way possible.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Berlin Experience</h3>
                        
                        <p>Berlin itself was probably the best place I've ever lived, especially during summer. The city pulses with energy, offering countless activities and a truly international community. After work, I could step into a world of diverse perspectives and backgrounds, with people from everywhere bringing their unique outlooks to conversations.</p>
                        
                        <p>That said, working life had its challenges too. Collaborating with colleagues across different time zones sometimes proved difficult, requiring early mornings or late nights to sync up with teams especially the ones in California. And in a curious observation, I noticed how the mood around the office would subtly shift with Tesla's stock price movements—you could almost guess the share price by the atmosphere in morning meetings.</p>

                                <img src="../assets/img/blog/tesla-experience/cybercab.png" alt="Tesla Cybercab Prototype, Berlin">
                            </div>
                            <p class="image-caption">Tesla Cybercab Prototype, Berlin</p>
                        </div> 
                       
                        <h3>Leadership Inspiration</h3>
                        
                        <p>Tesla organized frequent events and interactions with upper management, creating opportunities to hear directly from the minds shaping the company's direction. These sessions proved incredibly inspiring, offering insights into how Tesla's leaders approach problems and envision the future of transportation and energy. Their passion and strategic thinking reminded me why I wanted to work in this environment in the first place.</p>
                        
                        <p>For engineers contemplating where to focus their careers, I'd strongly recommend considering companies where your work can have exponential impact. The satisfaction of seeing your ideas multiply across thousands of products is something you just can't replicate in smaller-scale environments. And if you get a chance to do it in a city as vibrant as Berlin? Even better.</p>
